                    My name is Mike Riccardi.
                    I wrote my first "Hello World" at age 7 on my parents Apple IIe in 1988.
                    From that moment on my passion for computers grew exponentially.
                    I learned HTML, photoshop, and linux as a teen.
                    I had my first experiences with hardware upgrades, overclocking, MS Windows, and hardware
                    troubleshooting before age 15. At age 15 I held a tech support position at the Groton, CT naval
                    submarine base.
                    I built windows 3.11 and windows 95 desktop workstations and responded to helpdesk requests.
                    In high school I studied accounting and business law in addition to digital imaging, video editing,
                    and computers.
                    By age 20 I had sampled many linux distros and grown familiar with the commane line interface and
                    continued to dabble with html, computer hardware, and operating systems.
                    At age 22 I became a podcasting pioneer producing a weekly comedy audio podcast using my web design
                    and computer editing skills. Throughout my twenties I held several management positions, and also
                    worked as an accounting clerk.
                    I eventually grew tired of the repetitive nature of accounting, and At age 30 I opened Crash Clinic
                    Computers in 2011, my first startup.
                    The Crash Clinic was a great experience for me, and was a modestly successful company. Reaching over
                    1000 customers at it's peak, it served the southeastern CT area's residential and commercial IT
                    support needs.
                    During my time operating the Crash Clinic I developed a Linux distro for quickly diagnosing computer
                    hardware and network issues, which is currently in version 3.1 and available as a free download.
                    In 2016 I made the decision to sell the Crash Clinic to a friendly competitor, to establish more
                    free time to pursue my education in web and software development.
                    I enrolled and completed many online university classes and tutorials to quickly become a skillful
                    developer.
                    In febuary of 2016 I began work on a music-streaming app called <a
                            href="http://msrinteractive.com/robo" target="_blank">RoboRadio</a>, and in June of 2016 I
                    completed it and released it for Android in the Google play store.
                    Since April of 2016 I have enjoyed success as a freelance full-stack developer.
                    Having established several anchor clients, I continue to pursue my education in web development
                    while freelancing and actively seeking further career moves in web and software development.
